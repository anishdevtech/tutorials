# Stop Using `require()` in 2024: Upgrade to `import` ðŸš€

Welcome to the guide that accompanies our video on why you should stop using `require()` in 2024 and switch to `import` for faster, cleaner, and future-proof JavaScript code.

## ðŸ“œ Why Switch from `require()` to `import`?
`require()` has been the standard for a long time, but itâ€™s now considered outdated for several reasons:
- **Synchronous Nature:** `require()` is synchronous, which can block your code execution and slow down performance.
- **Limited Compatibility:** Many modern JavaScript packages, like `lodash-es` and `date-fns`, no longer support `require()`.
- **No Top-Level Await:** `require()` doesnâ€™t allow for top-level await, which is crucial for writing cleaner asynchronous code.
- **No Tree Shaking:** `require()` does not support tree shaking, leading to larger bundle sizes.

On the other hand, `import` offers:
- **Asynchronous Loading:** `import` is asynchronous, making your code non-blocking and faster.
- **Wide Compatibility:** Itâ€™s supported by modern packages and works in both Node.js and browsers.
- **Top-Level Await:** Allows the use of `await` at the top level, simplifying asynchronous code.
- **Tree Shaking:** Helps in reducing bundle size by removing unused code.

## ðŸš€ How to Upgrade Your Code from `require()` to `import`
Upgrading your code is straightforward! Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Identify `require()` Statements
Search through your codebase for any `require()` statements. These will typically look like this:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const lodash = require('lodash');
```

### Step 2: Replace with `import`
Replace each `require()` with an equivalent `import` statement. Here's how:

#### Example 1: Simple Module Import
```javascript
// Old way with require()
const fs = require('fs');

// New way with import
import fs from 'fs';
```

#### Example 2: Destructuring Import
```javascript
// Old way with require()
const { map, filter } = require('lodash');

// New way with import
import { map, filter } from 'lodash';
```

### Step 3: Handle Dynamic Imports (if needed)
If youâ€™re using dynamic imports with `require()`, you can use the `import()` function instead:

```javascript
// Old way with require()
const module = require('module-name');

// New way with import()
const module = await import('module-name');
```

### Step 4: Ensure Compatibility
- **Node.js Compatibility:** Ensure your Node.js environment supports ES modules by adding `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
- **Bundling Tools:** Update your bundling tools (like Webpack, Rollup) if needed to ensure full support for `import`.

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

### Step 5: Test Your Code
After refactoring your code, run your tests and make sure everything works as expected. This is crucial to ensure that the transition doesnâ€™t break your application.
