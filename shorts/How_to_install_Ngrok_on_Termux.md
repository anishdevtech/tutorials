# How to Install ngrok on Termux

Ngrok is a versatile tool that creates secure tunnels to your localhost, allowing you to expose local servers to the internet. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install and configure ngrok on Termux.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have:
- Termux installed on your Android device.
- A stable internet connection.

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### 1. Update Termux Packages

Begin by updating the package lists and upgrading installed packages to their latest versions:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

You'll need `wget` to download ngrok and `zip` to extract the files:

```bash
pkg install zip wget -y
```

### 3. Download ngrok

Download the ngrok binary from the official source:

```bash
wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-arm.zip
```

### 4. Unzip the Downloaded File

Extract the ngrok binary from the downloaded zip file:

```bash
unzip ngrok-stable-linux-arm.zip
```

### 5. Set Permissions

Grant the necessary permissions to the ngrok binary to make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ngrok
```

### 6. Connect Your ngrok Account

To use ngrok, you'll need to authenticate it with your account:
1. [Sign up for an ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) if you don't have one.
2. Once signed in, find your **auth token** on the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup).

Run the following command to link ngrok with your account, replacing `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token you retrieved:

```bash
./ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

### 7. Verify Installation

You can now start using ngrok. To confirm it's working correctly, you can view the help documentation:

```bash
./ngrok help
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Using ngrok

To expose a local web server running on port 8080 to the internet, use the following command:

```bash
./ngrok http 8080
```

This will create a public URL that forwards to your local server.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection when running ngrok.
- If you face connection issues, consider restarting Termux or using a different network.
